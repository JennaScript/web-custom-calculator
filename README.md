Custom Calculator
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This program/site is intended to calculate the entire cost of a user's purchase at a cannabis dispensary, based on user's input which would be the price of their choice of cannabis strain, the local county, and dispensary taxes.

This program will ask for four inputs: your cannabis retail price, the local county tax, the dispensary tax, and how many units of this strain you are purchasing. This program will then calculate the entire cost based on the user's input values.
