Custom Calculator
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
by Jennalyn Kabiling

This program/site is intended to calculate the user's input which is the price of their choice of cannabis strain, the local county, and dispensary taxes.

This program will ask for four inputs: your cannabis retail price, the local county tax, the dispensary tax, and select whether you are purchasing from either one to three units. This program will then calculate your entire cost based on the user's input values.
